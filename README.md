# How to Create a Landing Page with ChatGPT

In this project, we will explore how to create a responsive and mobile-friendly landing page using ChatGPT. Let's dive into it!

## 1. Create the Landing Page

First of all, we need to assign our task to ChatGPT. Here, we want to create a landing page for an AI Writer application, available on both iOS and Android. Below is the prompt:

```
You are a senior web developer. Write a landing page: 
1. introduce the "AI  Writer" iOS and Android APP. 
2. The page is responsive and mobile-friendly.
3. The app logo link: https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/20/ee/17/20ee170e-b8d6-2d43-4dc5-8d50d7fe4b78/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-0-0-6-0-0-sRGB-0-0-0-GLES2_U002c0-512MB-85-220-0-0.png/246x0w.webp
4. The iOS app download link: https://apps.apple.com/app/id1639845219
5. The Android app download link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ai.chat.writer
6. Add a button to call for action: Download Now
7. Use tailwind css. 
```
The prompt provides ChatGPT with the necessary details to execute the task. It includes the application name, the type of page (responsive, mobile-friendly), the logo, and download links for the app on iOS and Android platforms.

Here is the generated page: [Version 1](https://ai-writer.app/page/v1)

## 2. Add APP Screenshots

Next, we want to remove the logo from the background and add app screenshots instead. Here's the prompt for ChatGPT:

```
Update the code: 
1. Don't use the logo as background. 
2. Add three screenshot of the apps to the page with links:

```
With this prompt, ChatGPT will generate a code that includes the updated design.

Here is the generated page: [Version 2](https://ai-writer.app/page/v2)

## 3. Improve the Page Design

To improve the design, we add the logo to the top left of the page and make the page fit the whole screen. Here's the prompt for ChatGPT:

```
Update the code: 
1. add the logo to the top left of the page. 
2. Make the page whole screen. 
```
This prompt will guide ChatGPT to generate a code that ensures the logo is placed at the top left and the landing page fits the whole screen.

Here is the generated page: [Version 3](https://ai-writer.app/page/v3)

## 4. Add a Background

Finally, we improve the aesthetic appeal of the landing page by adding a background to the page. Here's the prompt:

Here is the generated page: [Final Version](https://ai-writer.app/)

```
Add this background to the page: https://img.freepik.com/free-photo/abstract-grunge-decorative-relief-navy-blue-stucco-wall-texture-wide-angle-rough-colored-background_1258-28311.jpg?w=2000
```
The prompt instructs ChatGPT to add the given background to the landing page.

## 5. Summary

In conclusion, using ChatGPT to create a landing page is easier and faster. Prompting the AI model with the correct instructions can lead to a beautifully designed landing page. Enjoy creating!
